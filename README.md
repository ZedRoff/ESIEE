## 🏗️ Projects

### 1. 🔢 Complex Calculator
**Language:** Java  
A calculator that computes operations with imaginary numbers and plots them on a graph.

### 2. 📘 IPA (Introduction to Programming and Algorithms)
**Language:** Java  
A collection of my solutions to graded exercises in ESIEE's introductory Java programming course.

### 3. 🎮 3D Maths
**Language:** Python  
A 3D graphics engine built to experiment with matrices, projections, rotations, plane normals, and more.

### 4. 🤖 Algorithm Project
**Language:** Python  
A second-year project led by René Natowicz, focused on algorithm complexity. The goal was to develop an efficient solution for an insect to find the shortest path to eat all the shrubs.

### 5. 🧭 ATL_2201
**Language:** Java  
A second-year course project involving 3D mathematics, where we manipulated vectors and transformations.

### 6. 🚦 Traffic Lights (Feux Tricolores)
**Language:** VHDL  
A VHDL project implemented on an FPGA, simulating a functioning traffic light system for a crossroads.
